This code is a simple QR code generator made purely using NodeJS. It uses the inquirer library to prompt the user for a URL, then uses the qr-image library to create a QR code image from the URL. The image is then saved to the file qrImage.png.

Here are the steps involved in generating the QR code:

1. Import the inquirer and qr-image libraries.
2. Create an inquirer prompt to ask the user for a URL.
3. Use the qr-image library to create a QR code image from the URL.
4. Save the image to the file qrImage.png.
